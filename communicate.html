		 What social media is great for communication? Most. Social media, at it's core, is about communication. However, some are better than others and some are easier to work out the communication side of things. For me, I'd recommend <span class="wapp">WhatsApp</span> or <span class="ttr">Twitter</span>. Both involve different types of communication.<br><br>
		<img src="images/whatsapp.png" alt="whatsapp logo" id="cwapp">
		<span class="wapp">WhatsApp</span> is great for direct communication amongst students, lecturers and anyone in between. It's layout is very similar to most text message layouts that are already on smart phones. The only difference is the use of mobile data or wifi versus your text message rate being charged. WhatsApp is great for sharing links, updates and reminders, and also has the option to video call and record voice messages which is great for project work or for students that are absent. WhatsApp is better for communication than, say, email, as it's something that as a student, I'd be more inclined to check but also, I don't have notifications on for emails. It's a great way to learn too as sharing is one of the best ways to learn, so if someone was to ask a question in my group chat and I knew the answer, I could answer it. The accessibility is what makes it such a usual, valuable app that colleges should start encouraging use for. We've had several lecturers have a lab with one group in the morning and need to change the lecture time later that day. If it's shared in the WhatsApp it takes the pressure of the lecturer to email every student and gives 20 other people the option to share it.<br><br>
		<img src="images/twitter.png" id="cttr" alt="twitter logo">
		<span class="ttr">Twitter</span> is also a great way to communicate! If students had dedicated student accounts and lecturers had dedicated lecturer accounts, a lot of resources could be shared, questions could be answered and many great conversations could be had. There's a lot of articles already circulating and hashtags often have a lot of usual information. Using Twitter would cut out the middle man and you could have direct access to these resources. Journalists also often use Twitter as a direct source and through the years, significant and important world leaders and important figures have used Twitter to speak to an audience. For example, during this COVID-19 situation, daily numbers were posted first on Twitter (it's immediate), live streams of briefings were both on Twitter and television (therefore more accessible for people) and daily updates from various ministers and reporters were shared far ahead of the daily newspapers and television. This could be used to keep students updated on relevant topics and the topics are endless.
