		 Which social media is best for sharing? Good question! Each social media has it's unique sets of features and there is no limit to what you can do, but if you're starting off, I would recommend <span class="slk">Slack</span> or <span class="fb">Facebook</span>.<br><br>
		<img src="images/slack.png" alt="slack logo" id="cslk">
		<span class="slk">Slack</span> has many features that allows us to share files, thoughts and links. It has a great chat option that most other social media doesn't have where you can upload and download files shared. This is really convenient as it means that you can share the files but also add commentary which you otherwise wouldn't be able to do otherwise unless it was through email. This part is set up much like other social media messaging so it's familiar but just has added features. It's much more geared towards a work environment but just has a similar instant layout to other social medias. It's primarily used for sharing and communicating but does have other features that you could explore further once you're comfortable with the website.<br><br>
		<img src="images/facebook.png" id="cfb" alt="facebook logo">
		<span class="fb">Facebook</span> is great for sharing links, articles and pages. It has the option of making several 'pages' where a lecturer could host different modules, or different groups. Students could then join the page and could find links to different resources like articles, relevant websites and other kinds of information. The lecturer could also record videos of explaining the lecture or the assignment given and this would be available for everyone to see. This is a much easier thing to navigate than the two to three links that Moodle requires to get you to a YouTube video etc.  It also means it's easily accessible for students and it's in a familiar format. Nearly every student, whether they use it or not, has a Facebook and would know how to use it.
