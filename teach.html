		 What social media is best for teaching? Not sharing, communicating, or the other things that come with the base task of teaching? Well, most are equipt for different kinds of teaching, but to deliver a module, I would recommend <span class="ytube">YouTube</span> or <span class="tt">TikTok</span>.<br><br>
		<img src="images/youtube.png" alt="youtube logo" id="cytube">
		<span class="ytube">Youtube</span> would be one of the original social medias and a social media that most people have a bare idea of. It's quite basic in what you can do - upload videos. You can of course edit and do other behind-the-scenes things but at it's  core, YouTube is for video uploading. This could be incredibly effective for uploading lectures, explanation videos and for making playlists of different videos that relevant to topics that are being discussed in that module. It also means others can access these at any time and several times. There is no time limit or use limit. You can also go 'live' on YouTube so that a lecturer could deliver a lecture and then it would be automatically published when it ends for those that forget. Something I've found with using Adobe Connect is lecturers forgetting to record the season. YouTube live offers a chat option just as Adobe Connect does. Though it doesn't cater to uploading files, they could be edited in after or linked in the description with time stamps. YouTube would be the simplest social media to use effectively for teaching without bending rules or rearranging it's use.<br><br>
		<img src="images/tiktok.png" id="ctt" alt="tiktok logo">
		<span class="tt">TikTok</span> is a really useful tool for short facts, quick questions and simple explanations. Though it limits how long your video is, it does give enough time for short videos for a question to be answered. This could definitely be effective when revising or going over a topic. For example, a series of TikToks explaining and showing examples of different positionings in CSS could be very good for visual and audio learners. TikTok also have a hashtag for 'EduTok' which features all kinds of educative clips. It also features people that may have better ways to explain it ie. people that have different views on the topic, people that have experience with the field or students that have a better understand of both the subject and how it's best for students to understand.
