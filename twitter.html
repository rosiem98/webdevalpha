			What is Twitter?
		</div>
		<div class="words1 twitter2">
			Twitter is a platform where people "tweet". A "tweet" is limited to 280 characters but can include external links, images, and videos. Others can like your tweet, retweet it to share to their own page and reply to your tweet underneath the original. Your tweets show up on your page but can also be seen on the timeline of people that follow you. You can set your Twitter profile to private so that others cannot see your tweets, likes or replies.

			How to Sign Up for Twitter
		</div>
		<div class="words2 twitter2">
			To sign up for Twitter, head to <a href="https://twitter.com/home">twitter.com</a> and at the top right corner, the option to log in or sign up is there. Hit 'sign up'. It will ask you for a name - this is your own name that everyone will be able to see. You can change this later on. You have the option to link either your phone number or email address to your account but you do need to choose one.

			How to use Twitter
		</div>
		<div class="words3 twitter2">
			As explained above, the main purpose of Twitter is to tweet. To tweet, click the Tweet button found at the top of your timeline (a stream of tweets from people you follow, found by clicking the 'Home' button on the left). Hit the Tweet button to send. You also have the option to attach links, videos, gifs, emojis and images here. These options are accessed by the icons to the left of the Tweet button once you opt to write a tweet. <br>
			Hashtags are also commonly used to distinguish a group of Tweets for trending topics. For example, &#35;FatherTed is trending today as it's the TV show's 25th birthday. If I add this &#35;FatherTed to my own tweet, others can click or search for the hashtag and see my tweet and others with the hashtag.

			Cautions about Twitter
		</div>
		<div class="words4 twitter2">
			Twitter is incredibly useful when used effectively. It does have some flaws and cautions that you should be aware of too. <br>
			You have a privacy setting which allows you some control. You can have a private account so that others can only see your header image, profile icon and your name and username. Your tweets, likes and replies are protected otherwise. You can also block specific users from seeing your profile.<br>
			You can set it up so that only people you follow can send you direct messages too. You can turn direct messages off as well.<br>
			You can report users for several reasons, or report a specific tweet if you see fit. These are looked at by moderators on Twitter's end to see why they would be reported, if they've been reported for the same reason or several times and if they find your complaint appropriate or viable. This can lead to users' accounts being deleted.<br>
			Twitter also has several privacy settings like your access to sensitive media, adding blocked or muted profiles, who can see your tweets and send you images. If privacy is a concern, it's always advised to limit what you share too.

			How to use Twitter to Teach
		</div>
		<div class="words5 twitter2">
			Twitter has a lot to offer when used for teaching. Of course it can be used for whatever you feel comfortable with, and whatever your knowledge allows you to do. But for begginers, this is what I'd recommend.<br>
			Twitter was initially built for communication, and the vast majority of their updates and add-ons are aimed at communication. Twitter is perfect for reminders of assignments or deadlines. You could have them turn their notifications on for your particular profile so that with each tweet you post, they'll be notified. It's much quicker than setting something up with Moodle and more effective than sending an email. Moodle notifies via email which, as a college student, I don't check all that often. I'd be on Twitter more often. For those that don't want to share their private, personal Twitter, the app and desktop allow you to be logged into several accounts at once. This allows a separation.<br>
			It's also effective for answering questions and having students reply with own thoughts, relevant links or images, etc. This also means there is a history that's accesible and others that miss it can look back on it. Worried about the character limit? You can create a thread! This links a series of tweets together so that you can go over the limit and others don't have to search for it.
